            <p>SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a powerful query language and protocol used for retrieving and manipulating data stored in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. Designed for querying linked data, SPARQL enables complex queries across diverse datasets, making it a crucial tool for semantic web and knowledge graph applications. With SPARQL, you can extract meaningful insights from interconnected data, paving the way for advanced data analysis and intelligent applications.</p>
